TO DO:
 - highlight selected cat in catList
 - style the app like your previous version

 ADMIN REQUIREMENTS
    should display: 
        - When the cancel button in the admin area is pressed, the admin area disappears.
        - When the save button in the admin area is pressed, the currently-selected cat's values update with the values in the admin area, and the admin area disappears.


make sure if someone doesn't enter an image with a .jpg (or .png?) that they get an error message

only allow whole positive integers for click count input

get cancel to work


cancelButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
            newImage = selectedCat.url;
            newCount = selectedCat.count;
            newName = selectedCat.name;
            console.log('hi');
        })
