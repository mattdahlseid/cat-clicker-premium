# cat-clicker-premium
## Overview
This is an optional project within [Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program that is used to demonstrate knowledge of MVC (Mode, View, Controller) JavaScript architecture. Udacity uses the terms Model, View, Octopus in its course.

Students were asked to build two "Cat Clicker" projects from scratch. The first was assigned prior to the MVC lessons, while the second (Cat Clicker Premium) was assigned following the MVC lessons. 

Cat Clicker Premium keeps count of the number of times a visitor clicks on a cat and holds images and click counts of up to five cats. The cat names and images can be changed to those of the user's choice within an "edit cats" menu.
